## How to install?

###### Cloning the repo
Just clone this repo inside of any directory. It really doesn't matter. For this 'tutorial' I will be using /home/$USER/OAuth2/, clone to there using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prifixy/OAuth2-Python.git ~/OAuth2
```

###### Dependencies (pip)
All dependencies are in the requirements.txt file, just install all of them by running the following command inside your directory.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

###### Editing the configuration
You need to edit both the `app.py` and `oauth.py` files. Add your Discord OAuth bot information, your redirect URL and configure the files to your needs.

###### Running
```bash
python3 ~/OAuth2/app.py
```
